# Hello There

If you're seeing this, I was asked to provide a Website URL for an application, specifically for the Front End Developer role at Mujin. Unfortunately, I have never really maintained a separate portfolio outside of my private account using for development at my current job. Technically, I have only ever worked for the one continuous job (with just over a years break) and saw myself continuing there for even further into the future.

That changed when I started considering looking for work outside of Australia, specifically in Japan, a country near and dear to my heart. Without a good portfolio to send you, I figured I'd put a little something together to show and tell a little about myself.

Any more information, including a formal resume, CV or references, is available on request.
